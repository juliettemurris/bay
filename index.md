  Hi, Welcome to my webpage!

  I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics within the [HeKA team](https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr/) (Inserm-Inria initiative) hosted at [PariSanté Campus](https://parisantecampus.fr/). My research is under the supervision of [Pr. Sandrine Katsahian](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sandrine-katsahian-98555679) from the CIC14-18 and Pompidou hospital (AP-HP) and [Audrey Lavenu](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/audrey-lavenu-7b160243) from [IRMAR](https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/).

  I am primarily interested in survival analyses, specifically for recurrent events in medical research.

  My PhD is a Cifre contract involving [Pierre Fabre laboratories](https://www.pierre-fabre.com/fr). This way, I am also a part-time engineer/biostatistician in the R&D department.

  Short CV:
  * I graduated from the [National School of Statistics](https://www.ensai.fr/) in France in 2018 with a major in Data Science for Healthcare
  * I worked fro 2.5 years at [Amaris](https://www.amaris.com/) as a consultant in Health Economics and Market Access
  * I joined the [master of Public Health](https://odf.u-paris.fr/fr/offre-de-formation/master-XB/sciences-technologies-sante-STS/sante-publique-K2NDGZO3/master-sante-publique-parcours-donnees-massives-en-sante-K168SJQL.html) at the University of Paris-Cité and then started a PhD in September 2021.
