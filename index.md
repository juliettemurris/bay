Hi, Welcome to my webpage!
<p>

I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics within the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/heka/fr/">HeKA team</a> (Inserm-Inria initiative) hosted at <a href="https://parisantecampus.fr/">PariSanté Campus</a>. My research is under the supervision of <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/sandrine-katsahian-98555679">Pr. Sandrine Katsahian</a> from the <a href="https://recap-inserm.fr/cic-ec-1418-fr.html">CIC14-18</a> and the Pompidou hospital (HEGP, AP-HP) and <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/audrey-lavenu-7b160243">Audrey Lavenu</a> from <a href="https://irmar.univ-rennes.fr/">IRMAR</a>.
<p>

I am primarily interested in survival analyses in medical research, with a focus on recurrent events. I also have a strong interest in any innovative technologies, specifically when related to machine learning/artificial intelligence stakes. 
<p>

My PhD benefits from a Cifre grant involving <a href="https://www.pierre-fabre.com/fr">Pierre Fabre laboratories</a>. This way, I am also a part-time engineer/biostatistician in the R&D department.
<p>

Short CV:

* I graduated from the <a href="https://www.ensai.fr/">National School of Statistics</a> in France in 2018 with a major in Data Science for Healthcare
* I worked for 2.5 years at <a href="https://www.amaris.com/">Amaris</a> as a consultant in Health Economics and Market Access
* I joined the <a href="https://odf.u-paris.fr/fr/offre-de-formation/master-XB/sciences-technologies-sante-STS/sante-publique-K2NDGZO3/master-sante-publique-parcours-donnees-massives-en-sante-K168SJQL.html">master of Public Health</a> from the University of Paris-Cité and then started a PhD in September 2021.
